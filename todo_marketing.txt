  [ ] what does it look like?
    [ ] can you walk me through what a potential experience would be like?
      [ ]

    [ ] how long does a session take?
      [ ] typically around 30min to an hour. depends on photographer (something you'll have to discuss w/ them personally)
    [ ] how many photos do i get?
      [ ] photographers would typically take as many shots as they can and have you choose 20-30 photos  that you like best or even more depending on how much time you spent doing photoshoots.
    [ ] what do i have to bring
      [ ] its generally a good idea to bring a few different wardrobes/shirts to diversity your look
    [ ] can i go to different locations/venues
      [ ] you can discuss with your photographer to take shots in 2-3 or more places if time allows for it. 

    [ ] how do i know which photographer to pick?
      [ ] It really depends on preference, some people look at the portfolio and see if they like they're style. Others focus more on whether they think can get along with the photographer and make them feel more relaxed throughout the experience. Also, if there are reviews listed in their profile, it help you gain more perspective as to what a potential experience would be like with them.

Your local laws and taxes
Take a moment to review your local laws. We want to make sure you’ve got everything you need to get off to a great start.

Please educate yourself about the laws in your jurisdiction before listing your space.

Most cities have rules covering homesharing, and the specific codes and ordinances can appear in many places (such as zoning, building, licensing or tax codes). In most places, you must register, get a permit, or obtain a license before you list your property or accept guests. You may also be responsible for collecting and remitting certain taxes. In some places, short-term rentals could be prohibited altogether.

Since you are responsible for your own decision to list or book, you should get comfortable with the applicable rules before listing on CryptoCribs. To get you started, we offer some helpful resources under “Your City Laws.”

By accepting our Terms of Service and listing your space, you certify that you will follow applicable laws and regulations.
